# Hotel Management System - Database Integration Complete

## What's Been Done

Your hotel management system now has **full Supabase database integration** for check-in/check-out functionality with proper billing tracking.

### 1. Database Schema (Supabase)
Created complete PostgreSQL database with the following tables:
- **hotels** - Hotel information and settings
- **users** - Admin and staff users
- **rooms** - Room inventory with QR codes
- **guests** - Guest records with full check-in/check-out and billing data
- **requests** - Guest service requests
- **food_items** - Restaurant menu items
- **room_service_items** - Room service menu
- **complaint_items** - Complaint categories

### 2. Guest Management Features

#### Check-In Process
When you check in a guest:
- Guest record is **saved to Supabase database**
- All billing information is stored:
  - Room rate per night
  - Total nights
  - Total amount (rate Ã— nights)
  - Advance payment
  - Paid amount
  - Pending amount
- Room status updates to "occupied"
- Guest details stored: name, phone, email, ID type/number, address
- Check-in and planned check-out dates recorded

#### Check-Out Process
When you check out a guest:
- Guest status changes to "checked-out"
- Actual check-out date is recorded
- Additional charges can be added (food, services, etc.)
- Final billing calculated:
  - Base amount (room charges)
  - Additional charges
  - Total paid amount
  - Pending balance
- Guest record is **updated in database** (not deleted, for history)
- Room status returns to "available"

### 3. Billing Tracking
The system maintains complete financial records:
- Initial booking amount
- Advance payments
- Additional charges during stay
- Final settlement
- Pending amounts
- All amounts stored in database for reporting

### 4. How to Use

#### Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server will:
- Connect to Supabase automatically
- Run on port 3001
- Handle all check-in/check-out operations

#### Check-In a Guest
1. Click on an available room
2. Fill in guest details:
   - Personal information (name, phone, email)
   - ID verification (type and number)
   - Stay dates (check-in and check-out)
   - Number of guests (adults and children)
   - Payment details (advance, total)
3. Click "Check In"
- Guest is saved to database
- Room becomes occupied

#### Check-Out a Guest
1. Click on an occupied room
2. Review billing:
   - Room charges
   - Add any additional charges
   - Record final payment
3. Click "Complete Check-out"
- Guest record updated in database
- Room becomes available
- All billing information preserved

### 5. Data Persistence
All data is stored in Supabase:
- Guests are NOT deleted on check-out (kept for history/reports)
- Room occupancy tracked in real-time
- Complete financial audit trail
- Guest history maintained

### 6. Important Notes
- **Check Out panel removed** from sidebar (as requested)
- Check-out still works by clicking occupied rooms
- All amounts tracked in database
- Both `_id` and `id` field formats supported for compatibility

### 7. Environment Variables
The server uses these from `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-key>
JWT_SECRET=humari-secret-key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3001
```

### 8. Database Access
You can view your data directly in Supabase:
- Login to Supabase dashboard
- View `guests` table for all check-ins/check-outs
- View `rooms` table for room status
- All data persists permanently

## Testing
1. Start the server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` (in project root)
3. Login to your hotel account
4. Try checking in a guest
5. Check the database - guest record will be there
6. Try checking out - record updates with final billing

## Backup
Your original MongoDB server has been backed up to:
`server/index-mongodb-backup.js`

The system now uses Supabase exclusively for all database operations.

# Hotel Management System - MongoDB Integration Complete

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your hotel management system now has **full MongoDB database integration** for check-in/check-out functionality with complete billing tracking.

### 1. Database Configuration

**MongoDB Connection**
- Located in: `server/.env`
- Variable: `MONGODB_URI`
- You need to add your MongoDB connection string

Example `.env` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/hotel-management
JWT_SECRET=humari-secret-key-for-hotel-management-system
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
PORT=3001
```

### 2. Database Schema (MongoDB/Mongoose)

#### Guest Schema
Complete guest tracking with billing:
- Personal info: name, email, phone, ID details, address
- Stay details: check-in/check-out dates, room assignment
- Guest count: adults, children
- **Billing fields**:
  - `ratePerNight` - Room rate
  - `totalNights` - Number of nights
  - `totalAmount` - Total bill (rate × nights + additional)
  - `advancePayment` - Payment received at check-in
  - `paidAmount` - Total amount paid
  - `pendingAmount` - Outstanding balance
  - `additionalCharges` - Extra charges (food, services)
- Status: checked-in, checked-out

#### Room Schema (Updated)
Complete room management:
- Basic info: number, name, type
- Pricing: rate (per night)
- Capacity: maxOccupancy
- Features: amenities array
- Status: available, occupied, maintenance, out-of-order
- QR code: uuid and qrCode fields
- **Guest tracking**: currentGuest (reference to Guest)

### 3. API Endpoints

All endpoints are now functional with MongoDB:

#### Guest Management
- `GET /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests` - Get all guests
- `POST /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests` - Check in a guest
- `PUT /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests/:guestId` - Update guest (check-out)
- `DELETE /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests/:guestId` - Delete guest record

#### Room Management
- `GET /api/hotels/:hotelId/rooms` - Get all rooms
- `POST /api/hotels/:hotelId/rooms` - Create room
- `PUT /api/hotels/:hotelId/rooms/:roomId` - Update room (FIXED)
- `DELETE /api/hotels/:hotelId/rooms/:roomId` - Delete room

### 4. Check-In Process

When checking in a guest:
1. Guest record is **saved to MongoDB**
2. All information stored:
   - Personal details
   - Stay dates
   - Room assignment
   - Billing: rate, nights, total, advance, pending
3. Room status updates to "occupied"
4. Room's `currentGuest` field set to guest ID

**Frontend → Backend Flow:**
```
PositionCheckIn.tsx → apiClient.createGuest()
→ POST /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests
→ MongoDB Guest collection
```

### 5. Check-Out Process

When checking out a guest:
1. Guest status updated to "checked-out"
2. Additional charges added to total
3. Final payment recorded
4. Pending balance calculated
5. Room status returns to "available"
6. Room's `currentGuest` field cleared
7. **Guest record kept in database** (for history)

**Update Flow:**
```
PositionCheckIn.tsx → apiClient.updateGuest()
→ PUT /api/hotels/:hotelId/guests/:guestId
→ MongoDB update
```

### 6. Room Edit/Update (FIXED)

The room update now properly handles all fields:
- Type (Standard, Deluxe, Suite, etc.)
- Status (available, occupied, maintenance, out-of-order)
- Rate (price per night)
- Max Occupancy
- Amenities
- Current guest tracking

### 7. Billing Tracking

Complete financial tracking in MongoDB:
```javascript
{
  ratePerNight: 2500,
  totalNights: 3,
  totalAmount: 7500,        // 2500 × 3
  advancePayment: 2000,     // Paid at check-in
  paidAmount: 2000,         // Same as advance initially
  pendingAmount: 5500,      // 7500 - 2000
  additionalCharges: 0,     // Added at check-out
  status: "checked-in"
}
```

At check-out:
```javascript
{
  additionalCharges: 500,   // Food, services, etc.
  totalAmount: 8000,        // 7500 + 500
  paidAmount: 7000,         // 2000 + 5000 final payment
  pendingAmount: 1000,      // 8000 - 7000
  status: "checked-out"
}
```

### 8. How to Use

#### Setup MongoDB
1. Get your MongoDB connection string (MongoDB Atlas or local)
2. Add it to `server/.env`:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string
   ```

#### Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Server will:
- Connect to MongoDB
- Run on port 3001
- Handle all check-in/check-out operations

#### Check-In a Guest
1. Click available room in Position/Check In
2. Fill in guest details
3. Enter billing information
4. Click "Check In"
- Guest saved to MongoDB
- Room becomes occupied

#### Check-Out a Guest
1. Click occupied room
2. Add any additional charges
3. Record final payment
4. Click "Complete Check-out"
- Guest updated in MongoDB
- Room becomes available
- All amounts recorded

### 9. Data Persistence

All data stored in MongoDB:
- **Guests collection**: All check-ins/check-outs
- **Rooms collection**: Room inventory and status
- **Hotels collection**: Hotel information
- **Users collection**: Admin/staff accounts

Guest records are **NOT deleted** on check-out - they're kept for:
- Historical records
- Financial reporting
- Guest history tracking

### 10. Console Logging

The server now logs important operations:
```
✅ Guest checked in: John Doe Room: 101
✅ Guest updated: John Doe Status: checked-out
✅ Room updated: 101 Status: available
```

### 11. Important Notes

- MongoDB connection string must be set in `server/.env`
- All amounts tracked in database
- Guest history maintained (not deleted)
- Room updates now work correctly
- Check-out updates guest record (doesn't delete)

### 12. Testing

1. Add MongoDB URI to `server/.env`
2. Start server: `cd server && npm start`
3. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
4. Login to admin panel
5. Add a room (with all details)
6. Check in a guest
7. Check MongoDB - guest record will be there
8. Check out the guest
9. Check MongoDB - record updated with check-out info

### 13. Troubleshooting

**If check-in doesn't work:**
- Check MongoDB connection in server logs
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `server/.env`
- Check browser console for errors

**If room edit doesn't save:**
- Ensure all fields are filled
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify room ID is correct

**If amounts don't calculate:**
- Check that rate and nights are set
- Verify advance payment is a number
- Look at server logs for calculation errors
